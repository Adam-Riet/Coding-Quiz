## Coding Quiz

## Description
Put your coding knowledge to the test! Five points for every correct answer. See if you can get the highscore. Keep in mind you lose five points for every incorrect answer.

## Usage
This quiz is a great place to see JavaScript event listeners in action. With the click of a button you can have JavaScript modify and replace HTML elements. This is also made possible with querySelecter to target classes or IDs you have assigned to HTML elements.
